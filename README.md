# NFL-Web-Scrape-V2
In-process NLF.com web scraping programs transfer to jupyter lab notebooks

## This incomplete project was to practice scraping NFL player stats from NFL.com for general fantasy football league use.
### Will restart the project using data from nflfastR API: https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR when the 2024 season begins!
